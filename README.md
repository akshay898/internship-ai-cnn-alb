# Intelligent album creator

Tech used: OpenCV, Keras and CNN

A loading train set runs the project, in which we train and test the model with a given image so that it can classify the image into the appropriate folder. Tkinter (in-built libary) was used to create a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users can easily use the graphical user interface. The GUI opens a new window and displays an option to open the image, as well as predicting the image.
